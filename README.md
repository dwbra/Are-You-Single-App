# Are You Single App

### An application to get someones contact info in a chill way when you may not be able to ask directly.

I came up with this idea whilst on a flight with an attractive air hostest. I wanted to ask her for her number but I didn't want to put pressure on it as she was at work.

I thought that it would be a great opportunity to build my first React Native application using Formik to create a multistep form.
